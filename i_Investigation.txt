Study Title	"Metabolic and transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and mutants to Phytophtora infestans"
Study Description	"The oomycete P. infestans is the causal agent of late blight, the most devastating potato disease. In contrast to potato, A. thaliana is able to successfully prevent colonization of the pathogen due to a multi-layered nonhost resistance. Several mutants have been isolated which are impaired in penetration resistance. A mutation in the gene PEN2, which encodes for an enzyme involved in indole glucosinolate metabolism, results in the loss of penetration resistance against P. infestans. Despite its ability to penetrate epidermal cells of pen2 mutant plants, P. infestans is still not able to colonize these plants. Additional mutants were isolated which show enhanced defense responses upon infection with P. infestans: pen2erp1 and pen2erp2, and backcrossed mutants erp140 and erp2D. We used 6 different plant lines, the wildtype-like gl1, and the five different mutants (pen2, pen2erp1, pen2erp2, erp2D, erp140). The plants were either infected with P. infestans spores or treated with water as control, and harvested 6 h and 12 h after treatment. The experiment was repeated 3 times with different P. infestans cultures, resulting in biological triplicates, for an overall of 6 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 72 samples."

Study Protocol Description	"Total RNA was isolated according to[1] and purified using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit. Labelling was performed by AROS APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY (Aarhus, Denmark). Nucleic acid hybridisation was performed by AROS APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY (Aarhus, Denmark).
</p>
Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) was propagated on barley (cultivar Ingrid, line I-10). Arabidopsis plants were inoculated using a settling tower, as previously described[2]. To score pathogen invasion and cell death in the epidermis, 3 leaf samples of each genotype were taken at 2 dpi and analyzed microscopically under UV light[3]. 100 interaction sites were scored per leaf. Microscopic analyses were carried out at 6 dpi, and macroscopic phenotypes were monitored at 9 dpi.
</p>
The growth of G. cichoracearum (strain UCSC1) and infection of A. thaliana was performed as described by Adam et al. (1999). Microscopic analyses were carried out at 7 dpi. A minimum of 9 leaves of different plants from each genotype was monitored in each experiment.
</p>
Bacteria were infiltrated into Arabidopsis rosette leaves using a needleless syringe. For the determination of bacterial growth, P. syringae pv. tomato (Pto DC3000 and Pto DC3000 avrRPM1) was infiltrated at 1 x 105 cfu/ml and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) was infiltrated at 1 x 108 cfu/ml.  Immediately after infiltration (0 dpi) and at 4 dpi, bacterial titers were determined. In a minimum of 3 experiments, 3 leaf disks of 9 mm in diameter of 3 different plants per genotype were sampled and ground in 0.2 ml of 10 mm MgCl2. Bacterial growth was determined by plating serial dilutions (3 technical replicates) on nutrient agar plates and counting the cfu after incubation for 2 days at 28 °C.
</p>
For callose assays, Pto DC3000 avrRPM1 was infiltrated at 5 x 105 cfu/ml and aniline blue staining was performed 2 dpi.

PMID:16293760</br>"	"Plant material was homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar and aliquots of 50 +/- 5 mg were weighed into pre-cooled 2-ml, round bottom tubes. After addition of 100 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) pre-cooled at –40 °C the samples were immediately vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 x g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2-ml tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 100 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v). The combined extracts were filtered using 0.2-µm PTFE syringe filters. 3 extracts (technical replicates) were prepared for each of the 72 leaf pools."	"Chromatographic separations were performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 µm; Waters) with a flow rate of 150 µl/min at 40 °C column temperature using the following gradient program: 0-60 s, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 60-360 s, linear from 5% to 30% B; 360-600 s, linear from 30% to 95% B; 600-720 s isocratic 95% B. The injection volume was 2.0 µl (full loop injection).
</p>
Elution of metabolites was detected with the help of a Waters Acquity UPLC Photodiode Array (PDA) detector. The DAD signal was acquired from 190 to 500 nm (step 0.25 nm) with a resolution of 0.25 nm, at a frequency of 20 points/s."	"Eluting compounds were detected with a spectra rate of 3 Hz from m/z 50–1000 using a MicrOTOF-Q-II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in either positive or negative ion mode with the following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.2 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 8 l/min, 190 °C; capillary, 4500 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; hexapole RF, 100 V. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µl 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) at a gradient time of 720 s using a diverter valve."	"Raw data files were converted to mzData format using the vendor-specific CompassXport (http://www.bdal.de/) and processed using the XCMS package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). XCMS settings for processing LC/MS data with findPeaks.centWave() were prefilter=(3,200); snthr=5; ppm=25; peakwidth=(5,12). For alignment group.density() function with parameters minfrac=0.75 and bw=2 was used. The processing of the CEL files was performed with the R-package simpleaffy."
