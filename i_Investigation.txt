Study Title	"Metabolic and transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and mutants to Phytophtora infestans"
Study Description	"The oomycete P. infestans is the causal agent of late blight, the most devastating potato disease. In contrast to potato, A. thaliana is able to successfully prevent colonization of the pathogen due to a multi-layered nonhost resistance. Several mutants have been isolated which are impaired in penetration resistance. A mutation in the gene PEN2, which encodes for an enzyme involved in indole glucosinolate metabolism (Bednarek et al. (2009)), results in the loss of penetration resistance against P. infestans (Lipka et al. (2005)). Despite its ability to penetrate epidermal cells of pen2 mutant plants, P. infestans is still not able to colonize these plants. Additional mutants were isolated by Kopischke et al. (2013) which show enhanced defense responses upon infection with P. infestans: pen2erp1 and pen2erp2, and backcrossed mutants erp140 and erp2D. We used six different plant lines, the wildtype-like gl1, and the five different mutants (pen2, pen2erp1, pen2erp2, erp2D, erp140). The plants were either infected with P. infestans spores or treated with water as control, and harvested 6h and 12h after treatment. The experiment was repeated three times with different P. infestans cultures, resulting in biological triplicates, for an overall of 6 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 72 samples."

Study Protocol Description	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	"Plant material was homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar and aliquots of 100 +/- 5 mg were weighed into pre-cooled 2-ml, round bottom tubes. After addition of 200 µL methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) pre-cooled at –40°C the samples were immediately vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 15 min at 20°C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 x g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2-ml tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 200 µL methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v). The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge at 30°C, thoroughly reconstituted in 200 µL methanol/water, 30/70 (v/v) and filtered using 0.2-µm PTFE syringe filters. Four extracts (technical replicates) were prepared for each of the four leaf pools."	"Chromatographic separations were performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 µm, Waters) applying the following binary gradient at a flow rate of 150 µL/min: 0-1 min, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 1-16 min, linear from 5 to 45% B; 16-18 min, isocratic 95% B; 18-20 min, isocratic 5% B. The injection volume was 3.0 µL (full loop injection)."	"Eluting compounds were detected from m/z 100-1000 using a micrOTOF-Q II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive and negative ion mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.4 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 L/min, 190°C; capillary, –5000 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 V; funnel 2 RF, 200 V; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 V; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 7 eV; collision RF 150/350 V (timing 50/50); transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 5 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 3 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µL 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) at a gradient time of 18 min using a diverter valve."	""	"Raw data files were converted to mzData format using the vendor-specific CompassXport (http://www.bdal.de/) and processed using the XCMS package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). XCMS settings for processing LC/MS data with findPeaks.centWave() were prefilter=(3,200); snthr=5; ppm=25; peakwidth=(5,12). For alignment group.density() function with parameters minfrac=0.75 and bw=2 was used."
